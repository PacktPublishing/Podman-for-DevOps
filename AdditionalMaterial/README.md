# Additional Material
In this directory and in this file you will find any additional material that could be useful for working with the practical examples contained in the book: "Podman for DevOps", published by Packt.

## Cleaning up the lab environment
The commands below could be really useful to clean up the lab environment once we complete a Chapter of the book:
1. ```podman stop --all``` # stop all running containers
2. ```podman rm --all``` # remove all running containers
3. ```buildah rm --all``` # remove all Buildah containers
4. ```podman rmi --all``` # remove all container images
