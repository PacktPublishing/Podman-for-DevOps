**Containerization reimagined with Podman and its companion tools**

## What is this book about?
DevOps best practices encourage the adoption of containers as the foundation of cloud native ecosystems. As containers have become the new de facto standard for packaging applications and their dependencies, understanding how to implement, build, and manage them is now an essential skill for developers, system administrators, and SRE/operations teams. Podman and its companion tools Buildah and Skopeo make a great toolset to boost the development, execution, and management of containerized applications. Starting from the basic concepts of containerization and its underlying technology, this book will help you get your first container up and running with Podman. The book explores the complete toolkit and illustrates the development of new containers, their lifecycle management, troubleshooting, and security aspects. 

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Understand Podman’s daemonless approach as a container engine
* Run, manage, and secure containers with Podman
* Discover the strategies, concepts, and command-line options for using Buildah to build containers from scratch
* Manage OCI images with Skopeo
* Troubleshoot runtime, build, and isolation issues
* Integrate Podman containers with existing networking and system services
